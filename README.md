This project analyzes the spatial distribution of flood incidents in DKI Jakarta (2024) using R and QGIS. The workflow covers data preprocessing, buffer and overlay analysis, centrographic statistics, point pattern analysis (Nearest Neighbor Analysis, Quadrat Analysis, Ripley’s K/L Function), global spatial autocorrelation (Moran’s I), and spatial regression (OLS, SAR, SEM). Population density is examined as a key explanatory variable. All codes and project files are provided for reproducibility and academic use.
